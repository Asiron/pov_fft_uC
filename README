Persistence of Vision Display

Code for microcontroller part of POV project.

Receives data over Bluetooth and saves it in buffer and then once the buffer is full, it sends it over SPI to TLC LED drivers.
Uses transmission initialization to make sure that it is receiving proper data.

Protocol description:

  FFT algorithm is run with music on PC app using Processings 2.0 Minim library.
  Data is prepared in 8bit color format and then transformed to 12bit color format, because TLC drivers support 12-bit PWM.
  255 has to be send 5 times in order to start transmission after that uC waits for a following 180 bytes to print it to LEDs
